        <p>Project Reflection:</p>
        <p>In my creation of this project the most difficult part was the creative writing aspect. 
        While I do have a creative brain, my imagination needs a kickstart to run with an idea. 
            I appreciated the prompts that were given to help in the writing aspect. Over all I 
            was really happy with how this project turned out. The tokens I made showcase the 
            abilities I learned while using Adobe Illustrator. I did not have many technical 
            issues in using the software as the lessons were really extensive and detailed. 
            This is a project of imagination and creativity. Read along and enter my 
            mythozoological world showcasing the folklore of Ireland. </p>

    <p>Come and join them for a showcase of mystery and magic! Scientists and researchers across
the world have come together with their findings of a host of species from Irish folk tales for their
annual symposium. Including Leprechauns, banshees, merrows, pookas, and Oilliphéists.
Across the emerald hills, fog undulates and curves around old oak trees and a moss-covered stone
path leading to an archway. A brass plaque read: The 125th annual symposium of Mythozoological
Discoveries. Beneath it an arrow pointing through the tunnel to the Great Hall. Lit up by green and
gold flame candles, shining against the stone walls.
When inside, there was an unusual energy, a mix of wonder, skepticism, and a scent of pipe smoke.
Scholars and scientists from around the globe whispering in hushed tones, carrying notebooks and
field kits. This evening was not an ordinary scholarly gathering; tonight, they would unveil proof of
Ireland’s most shifty creatures of story, superstition, and song.
Dr. Carlton O’Malley stood at the podium, his round spectacles glaring in the candlelight. “For
centuries,” she began, “We’ve dismissed these tales as folklore. However, the evidence compiled by
our world renowned scientists and scholars speaks the truth.” Uncovering the first exhibit: a glass
case containing a tiny leather shoe, smaller than that of a thumb. Leaning in and holding their breath
the audience could barely stay still. “Recovered in a forest near Kerry County, residue analysis
shows traces of gold dust and aged whiskey.” A ripple of awe ran through the crowd.
Next came the haunting wail from a recording, the cry of a banshee. The sound filled the hall, cold
and misery, raising goosebumps even on the most skeptical researchers. “Captured near an
abandoned manor,” explained O'Malley in a hushed voice. “Notice the harmonic resonance unlike
that of the human vocal frequency.”
Then came footage of a merrow emerging from a moonlit covered ocean, her hair slicked back with
seawater, eyes ancient and eerie. Samples of woven seaweed clothing were passed around the
audience. The murmurs from the crowd were unmistakable. Was it possible?
The presentation climaxed with chaos, the great screen showed sonar scans of something vast
beneath Lake Fruiensholl, scales like armor, and eyes like fire, the legendary Oilliphést. Applause
and disbelief erupted from the crowd. The air went stale. The creatures themselves were listening.
Somewhere.
Dr. O’Malley smiled faintly, closing his notes. “Ladies and gentlemen,” he said, “perhaps the
greatest discovery is not that these beings exist, but that they never truly left us.” As the candles
flickered, one could almost swear they saw movement in the shadows, a glint of gold, a ripple of
seagreen, a flick of a tail; reminders that mystery and magic still linger in the air, just at the edge of
science and magic.</p>

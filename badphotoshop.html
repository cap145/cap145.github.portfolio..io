    <h1>Bad Photoshop Project</h1>
         <p>Tools/software used: Photoshop</p>
        <p>Project Reflection:</p>
        <p>In creating this project I encountered quite a few issues with utilizing the tools on photoshop, such as the eraser, cliping, and 
    stamping tools. I was limited in my supplies that I took photos of and do think I could have done a better job with the found objects I used. The Pill Flower Bush digital creation was my original idea and the other two were after thoughts. I do like the Altoid Pyramid with the little 
    pill faces and think those two turned out well. The Pill Bed and Altoid Blanket I did not spend as much time and effort as I could have. This one was the most difficult image as there were unforseen issues with the cloning and eraser tool.</p>

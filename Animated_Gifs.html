        <p>Project Reflection:</p>
        <p>In creating these digital art pieces, it was frustrating when I could not get the system to work properly. 
            After quite a few failed attempts using different imagery, I realized that I was doing everything properly, 
            but there were too many color profiles in the vector images I was using and needed to come up with a new 
            concept and plainer imagery. I am happy with the way these animated gifs turned out and I learned so much over the course of this module. </p>

        <p>Project Reflection:</p>
        <p>in reflecting on this project, it was very challenging. I had many 
        issues rmembering how to type specific codes and design elements on my 
        webpages. Overall I was happy with how they tunred out. By the end of 
        the project I was having fun with it and think coding is super cool 
        and glad I got to learn such an interesting skill. The Texture page 
        I created is my favorite, I was letting my inner thoughts flow and 
        leaned into the weird with my creative choices. </p>

    <h1>Perfect Mask</h1>
     <p>Tools/software used: Photoshop</p>
        <p>Project Reflection:</p>
        <p>This project based on the artist John Baldessari and his artwork was a fun project, I throughly enjoyed creating the masks of these founds images. I think this art style is eyecatching
        and fun. In creating these artworks I chose found images that had a wide variety of contrast, which would help the bright colors shine through. I did not have any issues with this project,
        having used this style of masking in photoshop before, it was a project I could enjoy and really think about my photo choices.</p>

    <p>Utilized the masking tool in Photoshop to create these two artworks inspired by artist John Baldessari</p>

        <p>Project Reflection:</p><p>During this project and module reflecting on pixels, I had previous knowledge of them and how they work. Pixel art was very popular when I was a child, and my brother and I used to play around with Microsoft Paint and make pixel photos. I also grew up with the box television, and when the movie would stop playing, the screen would go “fuzzy.” As someone who used to sit way too close to the TV, I was able to see each little pixel. My understanding of pixels expanded through this Photoshop exercise. I did not encounter many issues when creating these pieces. Some artist choices such as the color changes 
        I made were because I thought it helped in defining the pixels, and because I liked the color adjustments better than the original color files.</p>

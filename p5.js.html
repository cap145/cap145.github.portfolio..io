        <p>Project Reflection:</p>
        <p>During the process of this assignment even after watching all of the lessons I was still at a loss of just how to do this. It was a lot of typing and re-typing untill I figured out how the figures moved along the axis.
        It was an interisting digital practice that I had never thought I would be drawing digital images using a java script software. Like the Glitch and Grit project this one also seemed daunting, but I am happy with the results. 
            I put effort into trying over and over again until I got it right. In my creative choices with the landscape photo, I wanted to add depth to the drawing and make it seem less two-dimentional. I succeeded in this by making 
            the tree in the background smaller to show the tree in the foreground as closer to the audience.</p>
